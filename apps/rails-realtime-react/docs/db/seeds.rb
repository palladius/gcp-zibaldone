# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Note.create!(text: 'Hello Riccardo! If you change iut from FE it changes for all of them (FRAWESOME) but if you change it from rails console you need to actually RELOAD :/')
